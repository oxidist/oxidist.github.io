I finally understand why Avalokiteshvara and Manjushri, boundless compassion and transcendent wisdom, are inseparable aspects of the same [shūnyatā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81). Judgement colours perception. You need to be kind to yourself to see yourself clearly. And if you see someone clearly, you cannot help forgiving them.

My [last line](https://oxidist.github.io/2025/09/21/Lapidarist.html), reversed: if God is perfectly understanding, it is because He is perfectly forgiving. I was not wrong, but I only saw one side of it. Empathy isn’t caused by clarity, but inseparable from it.

Compassion and wisdom are wind on water. The wind doesn’t create the water, nor the water the wind. Wind without water is empty movement, and water without wind is stagnant surface. But wind on water—ripples, patterns, the play of light and motion. Aliveness. 

Distinct, and yet without boundary.
