<div style="p + p {text-indent: 0em;}">
<p>Defocusing my eyes, light refracting through tears,</br>

the vertical lines of the keyboard backlight become snake scales.</br>

The staggered rows—sinuous-snake—</br>

sidewind across my attention’s limbus.</br>

Looking through the window, not at it,</br>

light through salty water trickles down to lips that taste the lightsnake.</p>
</div>
