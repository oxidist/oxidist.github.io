<div style="p + p {text-indent: 0em;}">
<p>Defocusing my eyes, light refracting through tears,</p> 

<p>the vertical lines of the keyboard backlight become snake scales.</p>

<p>The staggered rows—sinuous-snake—</p>

<p>sidewind across my attention’s limbus.</p>

<p>Looking through the window, not at it,</p>

<p>light through salty water trickles down to lips that taste the lightsnake.</p>
</div>
