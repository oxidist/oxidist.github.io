Defocusing my eyes, light refracting through tears, 

the vertical lines of the keyboard backlight become snake scales.

The staggered rows—sinuous-snake—

sidewind across my attention’s limbus.

Looking through the window, not at it,

light through salty water trickles down to lips that taste the lightsnake.
