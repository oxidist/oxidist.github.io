I"‰<p>Youtube is either one of the best sources of information, or one of the worldâ€™s greatest time wasters.</p>

<p>In this one, Iâ€™m going to show you how to make it almost free from distractions and full of useful content.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<p>First, weâ€™re gonna remove the comments since most of them are useless and will probably lead to endless scrolling.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install AdBlock (for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/">firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">chrome</a>), and then, click on any video.</li>
  <li>After that, right click on the comment section, click â€œBlock this adâ€, and move the slider to the right till it blocks the whole comment section, it should look like this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, weâ€™re going to block some distracting channels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get a video/channel blocker extension (for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-blocker/jknkjnpcbbgcbdbaampbjlhkcghmgfhk?hl=en">chrome</a> &amp; for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-blocker/">firefox</a>)</li>
  <li>Block all distracting channels, by right clicking on their videos and then clicking â€œBlock videos from this channelâ€. Youâ€™ll never see them again.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the final step:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unsubscribe from those distracting channels that youâ€™re subscribed to (you know you are).</li>
</ul>

<p>And thatâ€™s how you, hopefully, make YouTube much less distracting than it was before.</p>
